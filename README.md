# Project Title : Code Challenge Toy Problems
## Project Description: 
    This project is part of phase 1 - week one canvas content. it contains, three seperate challenges, each independent form the other. The challenges include a student Grade generator, speed detector and a net salary calculator.
### Student Grade Calulator (toy Problem):
    A program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

### Speed Generator (toy Problem):
     a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### Net Salary Calculator (toy Problem):
     Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

## Project Setup
    The project is implement using javascript, html and css. index.html contains the markup for the forms.
    solutions to the code challenges are contained in javascript files with corresponding names to the code challenge. i.e, gradeCalculator.js contains the solution to the grade calculator challenge, e.t.c
